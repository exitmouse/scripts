Description: scripts.mit.edu Execsys system
 This package registers an interpreter based on cat for common files
 that are statically served to the web, such as .html or .jpg files,
 so that they can be executed as CGI scripts.
 .
 This is important for the scripts.mit.edu system because for security
 reasons, Apache cannot read these files unless they are "executed" as
 CGI scripts.
