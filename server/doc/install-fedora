Installing a Scripts guest on a Xen host
----------------------------------------

You need to create the volumes to use:

    lvcreate -n $MACHINE-root --size 50.00G $HOST
    lvcreate -n $MACHINE-swap --size 10.00G $HOST

Make sure that the console has an entry for this host:

    vim /etc/conserver/conserver.cf

If it doesn't, add:

    console $MACHINE {
        master $HOST;
        include xen;
    }

We use Kickstart to to initial Fedora configuration.  Installing a new
vanilla machine is as easy as:

    xm create scripts-server machine_name=$MACHINE install=fXX && console $MACHINE

The only prompt (near the beginning of the install process) should be
for the root password, and at the end, when it asks you to reboot.
Say yes, and the machine will power down, and then restart without
the install parameter:

    xm create scripts-server machine_name=$MACHINE && console $MACHINE
