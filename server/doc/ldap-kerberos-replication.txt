How to migrate from SSL authentication to GSSAPI authentication
===============================================================

NOTE: This document is strictly for HISTORICAL purposes.  It may
come in handy if you ever need to migrate from SSL to GSSAPI on
another LDAP setup, though!  This assumes that ldap service keytabs
are setup properly on all hosts involved.

----

On $CONSUMER (e.g. real-mccoy.mit.edu)

To cn=replica,cn="dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu",cn=mapping tree,cn=config:
Add nsDS5ReplicaBindDN: uid=ldap/$PRODUCER,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu
    This tells the CONSUMER to accept replication pushes from PRODUCER.
    However, PRODUCER is not configured yet, so you should keep
    the cn=repman,cn=config entry which is old style.

Create uid=ldap/$PRODUCER,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu
uid: ldap/$PRODUCER
objectClass: account
objectClass: top
    This creates the LDAP user entry for GSSAPI authentication via the
    service keytab of LDAP replication.  This information /is/
    replicated, so if you felt like it you could create entries for all
    PRODUCERS (which, in full multimaster replication, is all servers.)

----

On $PRODUCER (e.g. cats-whiskers.mit.edu)
    You will destroy and recreate a replication agreement (well,
    actually, ldapvi will attempt to create and then destroy the old
    agreement).

To cn="SSL Replication to $CONSUMER",cn=replica,cn="dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu",cn=mapping tree,cn=config
Replace all instances of "SSL Replication" to "GSSAPI Replication"
Replace the number on the entry with 'add'; to indicate destroy/recreate
Replace nsDS5ReplicaBindDN: uid=ldap/cats-whiskers.mit.edu,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu
    (instead of cn=repman,cn=config)
Replace nsDS5ReplicaTransportInfo: LDAP
    (instead of SSL)
Replace nsDS5ReplicaPort: 389
    (instead of 636)
Replace nsDS5ReplicaBindMethod: SASL/GSSAPI
    (instead of simple)
Remove nsDS5ReplicaCredentials

Here are some search-replace lines that will probably do what you want,
but be sure to double check how many substitutions were made. '<,'> lines
should exclude the cn=replica section.

    # n = NUMBER OF SERVERS - 1 = 4
    # n*3 substitutions
    :%s/SSL Replication/GSSAPI Replication/g
    # n substitutions
    :'<,'>s/cn=repman,cn=config/uid=ldap\/$HOST,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu/g
    :%s/simple/SASL\/GSSAPI/
    :%s/nsDS5ReplicaPort: 636/nsDS5ReplicaPort: 389/
    :%s/SSL/LDAP/g
    :%s/^nsDS5ReplicaCredentials.\+\n//g
    :'<,'>s/^nsds5replicareapactive: 0\n//g
    :%s/^[1-9] /add /g   # fix if more than 9 servers

There is some cleanup that needs to happen after these values change;
I had luck forcibly rebooting the servers and making LDAP cleanup
after an unclean shutdown.  You can tell if this cleanup is necessary
if LDAP refuses to start replication sessions.  This issue is known to
clear up after several reboots or by destroying and recreating all
replicas.

----

Once everything is on the new replication and you verify it's working
correctly, you should then clean out the SSL configuration (most
notably, turn nsslapd-security off. Despite its ominous name, it only
controls SSL authentication, not GSSAPI authentication.)  You will need
to take the server offline to do that; edit
/etc/dirsrv/slapd-scripts/dse.ldif

When that's gone, there may be some vestigial SSL configuration left.
Scripts specifically had the following sections that needed to be
cleaned up:

    cn=RSA,cn=encryption,cn=config
        (whole thing)
    cn=encryption,cn=config
        nsSSL3: on [change to off]
        nsSSL3Ciphers: +rsa_rc4_128_md5 [delete]
    cn=config
        nsslapd-sslclientauth: on [change to off]
