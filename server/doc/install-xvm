Installing a test scripts server on XVM
=======================================

It's useful to have a less secure scripts server for testing
purposes.  Here's what you have to do:

1. Creating the VM
------------------

To authenticate to xvm.mit.edu with root tickets, you need
a browser that suppors SPNEGO;  Firefox is one such browser and
the following instructions will assume it.  Browse to about:config
and modify the key 'network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris' to be

    https://xvm.mit.edu:442/*

Then, with active root tickets on your system, navigate to

    https://xvm.mit.edu:442/

You should be logged in as root, and if you are on scripts-root
you should be able to assign ownership to scripts.

[XXX: there should be a way to do this with remctl too]

2. Spin up
----------

These instructions are mostly the same as the latter part of
install-fedora, with the following changes:

VNC
---

You will not need to sketchily forward VNC, because XVM has a built
in VNC console.

Password
--------

Do NOT use the scripts-root password.  Pick something else.

Disks
-----

The standard Scripts setup has separate LVM partitions for root and
swap, as well as a non-LVM partition for boot.  You will not have this
for XVM, so the Fedora defaults mostly work.  Don't use ext4 though.
