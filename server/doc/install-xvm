Installing a test scripts server on XVM
=======================================

It's useful to have a less secure scripts server for testing
purposes.  Here's what you have to do:

1. Creating the VM
------------------

To authenticate to xvm.mit.edu with root tickets, you need
a browser that suppors SPNEGO;  Firefox is one such browser and
the following instructions will assume it.  Browse to about:config
and modify the key 'network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris' to be

    https://xvm.mit.edu:442/*

Then, with active root tickets on your system, navigate to

    https://xvm.mit.edu:442/

You should be logged in as root, and if you are on scripts-root
you should be able to assign ownership to scripts.

[XXX: there should be a way to do this with remctl too]

2. Configure
------------

Lest you be tempted to skimp on RAM:  you must have more than 700MBish
to install Fedora; 1024MB is a good amount is a good amount to give to
the server.  Disk space on order of 40G is probably good enough.

While it is best to use the install CD from the most recent version
of Fedora, any kernel which supports Kickstarting can be used.  A good
bet is to use the Netboot CD from the latest version of Fedora that
XVM has (since XVM is sort of bad about keeping their boot CDs up to
date.)

You will need VNC access to perform the installation process.  If you have
Java, just go to the Console page for the VM; if you do not, you can use
the following set of incants to setup a local VNC server which can talk
to the console:

    athrun xvm invirt-vnc-client -a $AUTHTOKEN
    vncviewer localhost

where AUTHTOKEN is the contents of the AUTHTOKEN param on the console page
(which would have had the Java applet.)

On the bootloader screen (usually it gives you a bunch of options
such as "Install" or "Advanced"), press TAB and edit the kernel boot
line to append the text:

    ks=http://ezyang.scripts.mit.edu/kickstart/scripts.php?type=xvm&release=$RELEASE_NO&hostname=scripts-f$RELEASE_NO-test.xvm.mit.edu

with $RELEASE_NO interpolated properly.  You should keep around any initrd
lines since the kernel image still needs to know how to boot up.

    XXX the kickstart file needs to live in a less sketchy place

The install process will ask you for a password.  Do NOT use the
scripts-root password.  We have a password in
/mit/scripts/Private/scripts-f9-test-passwd which we tend to use.
