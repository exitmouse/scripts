 # Configure each drive with a 1G partition and a rest-of-the-space partition, as RAID
 # Create a RAID1 for the 1G partitions

 # Create an ext3 /boot on the 1G RAID1
 # Create an LVM volume group named after the machine's short hostname
 # Create an LV called "swap" that is the same size as the machine's physical RAM
 # Create an LV called "root" that is 50G ext4

# ??? F11 will suggest ext4, DON'T USE IT.
