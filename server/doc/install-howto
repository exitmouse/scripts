This document is a how-to for installing a Fedora scripts.mit.edu server.

* Check out the scripts.mit.edu svn repository.

* cd to server/fedora in the svn repository.

* Run "make install-deps" to install various prereqs.

* Use the Makefile to build the scripts.mit.edu-specific Fedora
  packages.

* Install the full list of RPMs that users expect to be on the
  scripts.mit.edu servers.  See server/doc/rpm and
  server/doc/rpm_snapshot.

* Install the full list of perl modules that users expect to be on the
  scripts.mit.edu servers.  See server/doc/perl and
  server/doc/perl_snapshot.

* Install rails (versions 1.1.6 and 1.2.2).

* Install the credentials (machine keytab, daemon.scripts keytab, SSL
  certs).

* Configure apache (the apache config is not handled by the packages).

* I recommend setting noatime for the root filesystem in /etc/fstab.

* Possibly perform other steps that I've neglected to put in this
  document.
