This document is a how-to for installing a Fedora scripts.mit.edu server.

1.  Check out the scripts.mit.edu svn repository.
2.  cd to server/fedora in the svn repository.
3.  Run "make install-deps" to install various prereqs.
4.  Use the Makefile to build the scripts.mit.edu-specific Fedora packages.
5.  Install the full list of RPMs that users expect to be on the
    scripts.mit.edu servers.  See server/doc/rpm and server/doc/rpm_snapshot.
6.  Install the full list of perl modules that users expect to be on the
    scripts.mit.edu servers.  See server/doc/perl and server/doc/perl_snapshot.
7.  Install the credentials (machine keytab, daemon.scripts keytab, SSL certs).
8.  Configure apache (the apache config is not handled by the packages).
9.  I recommend setting noatime for the root filesystem in /etc/fstab.
10. Possibly perform other steps that I've neglected to put in this document.
