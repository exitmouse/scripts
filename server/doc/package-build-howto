This document is a how-to for building new packaages for scripts.mit.edu.

* Ensure you have a scripts-build user account, as documented in install-howto.

* su scripts-build -

* Use the Makefile to build the scripts.mit.edu-specific Fedora
  packages.
  - export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
  - make download
  - make setup
  - make all
  - openafs-devel is a build-dependency of accountadm, so you'll need to
    install the openafs-devel package you just built by hand when that fails.

* Add the packages to the repository by using a trusted machine to
  - krootscp root@build-server.mit.edu:/home/scripts-build/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86-64/* /mit/scripts/rpm/
  - cd /mit/scripts/rpm && createrepo .
  - If you don't have a trusted Fedora machine, you can use createrepo
    -o /tmp/foo . and then manually install the generated file

* Rebuild mit-zephyr on a 32-bit machine, like the one at Joe's home.
